        "- In this stick game, there are 20 sticks at the beginning. Each player (Python and the player) takes 1 or 2 sticks per turn. The player who takes the last stick loses. For the current strategy according to the code above, Python picks randomly between taking 1 or 2 sticks, without regard to the current game state or the number of sticks left. If only 1 stick is left, Python is forced to take the last stick and lose the game. This means Python is not playing optimally. If Python were playing intelligently, it would aim to force the player to take the last stick and leave the player in a losing position.\n",

These are the positions where, no matter what move you make (take 1 or 2 sticks), you will give the opponent a winning position. So, the ideal strategy is to make a move that leaves the opponent with one of these losing numbers of sticks.\n",

However, If Python goes first and plays optimally, Python can always leave the player in a losing position (when there are 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 sticks left ) and will always win.

        "- No, the AI strategy remains the same regardless of how many sticks are in the pile, but the chance of winning depends on the starting number and who goes first. The optimal strategy is to always leave the opponent with a losing position (when the number of sticks left is a multiple of 3 plus 1 (like 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.). The AI will attempt to reduce the stick count to one of these values on the opponent’s turn. This logic doesn’t change regardless of whether the game starts with 10, 20, or 100 sticks. However, the outcome will depend on whether the starting number is itself a losing position and whether the AI moves first. If the AI starts on a non-losing position and plays optimally, it can win. Conversely, if it starts on a losing position, then an opponent has the chance to force the AI to lose. Thus, the strategy remains constant, but the outcome is situational.\n"
